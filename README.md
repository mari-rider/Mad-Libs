# Mad-Libs

## Project I did in codecademy.com using Java

Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or strange). Mad Libs require:

- A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
- Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

For this project, codecademy provided the story and I completed the following:

- Create all the variables needed for the story.

- Print the story with the variables in the right places.

# Mad Libs:

1. Create a comment that describes the program.

2. Take a look at the variable named story. It is set equal to a string that will contain our story.
All of these variables will need to be declared and initialized before the code will compile without errors.

3. The story that we have provided is going to need a protagonist.
Create a String called name1 that stores the name of the main character.

4. You will need to provide three adjectives.
Create three Strings, adjective1, adjective2, and adjective3 and store different adjectives in them.

5. You’ll also need to provide one verb.
Create a String called verb1 and store a verb in it.

6. The story also needs six nouns.
Create six Strings, noun1, noun2, noun3, noun4, noun5, and noun6 

7. Our story needs another character. Declare a String variable called name2 and initialize it to the value of another name.

8. Our story requires one number. Declare an int variable called number and set it to any whole number you like.

9. There’s one more variable! Declare a String called place1 and store any place in it. This could be a city, or a town, or a country, or a planet!

10. Alright! It seems like we have all the variables we need. Save the file to see it run. Does it compile without errors?

11. Time to read the story! Use System.out.println() to print the story variable.

12. Put some whitespace in your code so that the story variable is hidden, and show your friends the code. Have someone else fill in the variables you have declared with the nouns, adjectives, verbs, and names that they like.
Then, run the code to see a new story get told!
